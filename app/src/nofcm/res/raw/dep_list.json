The idea is:\n\n    - If users want only ListenableFuture, they depend on listenablefuture-1.0.\n\n    - If users want all of Guava, they depend on guava, which, as of Guava\n    27.0, depends on\n    listenablefuture-9999.0-empty-to-avoid-conflict-with-guava. The 9999.0-...\n    version number is enough for some build systems (notably, Gradle) to select\n    that empty artifact over the \"real\" listenablefuture-1.0 -- avoiding a\n    conflict with the copy of ListenableFuture in guava itself. If users are\n    using an older version of Guava or a build system other than Gradle, they\n    may see class conflicts. If so, they can solve them by manually excluding\n    the listenablefuture artifact or manually forcing their build systems to\n    use 9999.0-....","artifactVersion":"9999.0-empty-to-avoid-conflict-with-guava","website":"","developers":[],"licenses":[]},{"description":"A set of annotations that provide additional information to the J2ObjC\n    translator to modify the result of translation.","name":"J2ObjC Annotations","id":"com.google.j2objc:j2objc-annotations:3.0.0","artifactVersion":"3.0.0","developers":[{"name":"Tom Ball"}],"website":"https://github.com/google/j2objc/","licenses":["Apache-2.0"]},{"name":"ZXing Core","id":"com.google.zxing:core:3.5.1","description":"Core barcode encoding/decoding library","artifactVersion":"3.5.1","website":"","developers":[],"licenses":[]},{"licenses":["MIT"],"developers":[{"name":"natario1"}],"website":"https://github.com/natario1/Egloo","artifactVersion":"0.6.1","description":"Egloo","id":"com.otaliastudios.opengl:egloo:0.6.1","name":"Egloo"},{"developers":[{"name":"natario1"}],"website":"https://github.com/natario1/Transcoder","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"description":"Transcoder","name":"Transcoder","id":"com.otaliastudios:transcoder:0.10.5","artifactVersion":"0.10.5"},{"artifactVersion":"5.0.0-alpha.14","name":"okhttp-java-net-cookiejar","id":"com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp-java-net-cookiejar:5.0.0-alpha.14","description":"Square’s meticulous HTTP client for Java and Kotlin.","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"website":"https://square.github.io/okhttp/","developers":[{"name":"Square, Inc."}]},{"licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"developers":[{"name":"Square, Inc."}],"website":"https://square.github.io/okhttp/","artifactVersion":"5.0.0-alpha.14","description":"Square’s meticulous HTTP client for Java and Kotlin.","name":"okhttp-urlconnection","id":"com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp-urlconnection:5.0.0-alpha.14"},{"website":"https://square.github.io/okhttp/","developers":[{"name":"Square, Inc."}],"licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"name":"okhttp","id":"com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:5.0.0-alpha.14","description":"Square’s meticulous HTTP client for Java and Kotlin.","artifactVersion":"5.0.0-alpha.14"},{"description":"A modern I/O library for Android, Java, and Kotlin Multiplatform.","name":"okio","id":"com.squareup.okio:okio-jvm:3.9.0","artifactVersion":"3.9.0","developers":[{"name":"Square, Inc."}],"website":"https://github.com/square/okio/","licenses":["Apache-2.0"]},{"artifactVersion":"3.9.0","description":"A modern I/O library for Android, Java, and Kotlin Multiplatform.","name":"okio","id":"com.squareup.okio:okio:3.9.0","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"developers":[{"name":"Square, Inc."}],"website":"https://github.com/square/okio/"},{"website":"https://insert-koin.io/","developers":[{"name":"Arnaud Giuliani"}],"licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"name":"Koin","id":"io.insert-koin:koin-android-compat:4.0.0","description":"KOIN -
